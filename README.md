# Crossbench voting data and analysis

This repo contains two datasets looking at voting in then 47th parliament of Australia. One dataset is sourced from Open Australia's [theyvoteforyou.org](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/help/data) API. The other, more detailed data is sourced from an unofficial API running on the [Australian Parliament House website](https://www.aph.gov.au/).
