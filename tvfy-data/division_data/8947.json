My amendments would give powers for the authority to develop and implement local energy hubs. The minister says, quite clearly, that the authority will be the shopfront for industry and investors. But I ask: Where is the community? What about community members and landholders who want to know more about what this industry is planning in their region? A local energy hub would be the shopfront for local communities situated in towns across regional, rural and remote Australia, staffed by trusted, reliable people who know the community and can assist them with understanding the renewable energy being built, how developers should engage with them and what benefit they and the wider community can receive from the project.*\r\n>\r\n> *My amendments also allow for a developer rating scheme. This is a recommendation of Professor Andrew Dyer's Community Engagement Review, accepted in principle by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen. A developer rating scheme would show the public a developer's track record on things like community engagement so that, when a landholder receives a letter in the mail or a knock on the door from a developer or prospector for the next solar farm, that landholder can assess whether that developer is in fact trusted and reputable.*\r\n>\r\n> *Critically, my amendments create pathways for communities to achieve regional prosperity, and they do this by creating powers for the authority to administer community benefit plans. Like the energy industry jobs plan already in the bill, a community benefit plan would demonstrate tangible benefits to communities that find themselves at the forefront of energy generation, storage or transmission for the very first time.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Clause 3, page 2 (line 16), omit \"ensure Australia's regions and workers\", substitute \"ensure Australia's communities and workers, especially in regional, rural and remote Australia,\".*\r\n>\r\n> *(2) Clause 3, page 2 (line 18), at the end of the clause, add:*\r\n>\r\n>> *;
