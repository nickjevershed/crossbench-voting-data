These amendments are housekeeping, actually. They require the authority to undertake an annual work plan. [...] These amendments require a long-term budget for the authority. [...] These amendments would also ensure that the authority supports communities in renewable energy zones. [...] My amendments add a provision which ensures that the minister's directions to the authority must not contradict the objects of the bill.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(9) Clause 16, page
