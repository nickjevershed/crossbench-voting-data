Earlier this week, I spoke on the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill 2024, and today these amendments are trying to address the issues there are with that bill. As the bill currently stands, it has a narrow and hypertargeted scope that fails to provide the authority with what is necessary to genuinely support a net zero economy transition. This bill restricts the type of employer or worker that is afforded that just transition to support under the act, specifically limited only to those transitioning from coal- and gas-fired power stations.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Clause 4, page 3 (line 24), omit \"or a gas-fired power station\", substitute \", gas-fired power station or other relevant facility or
