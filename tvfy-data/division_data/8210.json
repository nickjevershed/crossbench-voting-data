If the Prime Minister decides to select somebody for the position who is not on the shortlist, they must table a report within seven sitting days of the appointment naming the person and providing reasons why that person has the appropriate qualifications, skills and experience for the role.*\r\n>\r\n> *For the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner, the so-called 'guardian of an impartial Australian Public Service', as described by Thodey, there are a couple of additional requirements: that the independent panel be chaired by a former judge, and that the Prime Minister consult with the Leader of the Opposition on the appointment. This is in recognition that the Australian Public Service Commissioner is a unique role and reinforces to the Australian public the independence and impartiality of both the commissioner and the Australian Public Service.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(3) Schedule 1, page 8 (after line 25), after item 8, insert:*\r\n>\r\n>> *8A Section 45*\r\n>>\r\n>>> *Before \"The Commissioner\",
