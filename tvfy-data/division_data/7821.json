{"id": 7821, "house": "representatives", "name": "Anti-Discrimination and Human Rights Legislation Amendment (Respect at Work) Bill 2022 - Consideration in Detail - Extending protection", "date": "2022-11-07", "number": 6, "clock_time": "4:05 PM", "aye_votes": 69, "no_votes": 15, "possible_turnout": 151, "rebellions": 1, "edited": true, "summary": "The majority voted in favour of *disagreeing* with [amendments](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22legislation%2Famend%2Fr6916_amend_5bc8429f-95b8-4ae8-9d53-d0c49f3913f4%22;rec=0) introduced by Wentworth MP [Allegra Spender](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/wentworth/allegra_spender) (Independent), which means they failed and won't be included in the bill.\r\n\r\n### Rebellion\r\n\r\nBass MP [Bridget Archer](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/bass/bridget_archer) (Liberal) crossed the floor to vote 'No' in this division while the rest of her party voted \"Yes\". This means that Ms Archer supported these amendments.\r\n\r\n### What did the amendments do?\r\n\r\nMs Spender [explained that](https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2022-11-07.35.1):\r\n\r\n> *I celebrate the respect at work bill and I commend the government for putting forward this legislation at this time. However, in the noble pursuit of swiftly implementing the remaining findings of the Respect@Work report, this bill is too narrowly focused on sex. Hostile environment provisions and the positive duty to prevent discrimination do not extend to the full range of characteristics protected under the Sex Discrimination Act, including sexual orientation, gender identity, intersex status, pregnancy or relationship status. In particular, this bill does not provide appropriate protection to LGBTQ people. That is absolutely crucial in our consideration because there's ample evidence that LGBTQ people are particularly vulnerable to hostile environments in the workplace and are particularly vulnerable to the mental health impacts of such environments.*\r\n>\r\n> *The bill also creates inconsistency in terms of what we're asking from business, who must already comply with antidiscrimination law that relates to all the protected characteristics under the Sex Discrimination Act.*\r\n>\r\n> *The amendment I have moved extends the hostile workplace environment and positive duty provisions in this bill to cover all characteristics that are protected under the Sex Discrimination Act. It provides protections for the LGBTQ community and greater consistency and ease of implementation for business. I commend the amendment to the House.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1)     Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 12), after \u201csex\u201d, insert \u201c, sexual orientation, gender identity,
