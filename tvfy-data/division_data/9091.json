The government has considered my amendments, and I thank the Treasurer and his team for the discussions that we've had in that respect. I believe part of one of my amendments will be offered up as part of a government amendment, which will address some concerns but not all of the concerns that I've expressed. I understand the government will adopt, in part, one of my amendments, which is in respect to First Nations communities and traditional owners being able to participate in and share the benefits of the net zero transition. This is important, and I welcome this move.*\r\n>\r\n> *However, I understand they're not going to accept the amendments around making sure emissions reduction is at the core of a future made in Australia. They believe it's already implicit in this bill, but, as we see too often in this place, there is no such thing as being implicit in legislation. It must be explicit. Specifically, the amendments I've moved to the preamble and objects of this act make reference to the Paris Agreement in keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees of warming. We must ensure an investment of the scale of Future Made in Australia is in line with that commitment; it must be linked to that.*\r\n>\r\n> *The current bill considers decarbonisation and the net zero economy considerations in only one stream, with the second stream referring to economic resilience and security. But you cannot have economic resilience and security unless you are operating in a net zero economy. Therefore, my amendments expressly state that support under this stream is for economic resilience, climate resilience and security within a net zero economy. These amendments will not only safeguard against the Future Made in Australia supporting fossil fuel projects, which absolutely should not happen, but also ensure that any support under the legislation, whether it be for medical manufacturing or defence manufacturing, is given to a project and business aligned with net zero goals.*\r\n>\r\n> *My amendments also mean that sector assessments must take into account direct emissions and decarbonisation potential, recognising that some projects, such as critical minerals value-adding, may add to Australia's emissions but, ultimately, lead to a substantial net decrease in emissions over their life cycle through the decarbonisation that they will enable\u2014for example, electric vehicles and batteries. We must integrate decarbonisation in every aspect of legislation, especially when we are talking about the substantial spending of public money.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Preamble, page 2 (lines 16 to 17), omit \"economic resilience and security\", substitute \"economic and climate change resilience and security in a net zero economy\".*\r\n>\r\n> *(2) Clause 3, page 4 (line 12), omit \"economic resilience and security\", substitute \"economic and climate change resilience and security in a net zero economy\".*\r\n>\r\n> *(3) Clause 3, page 4 (line 33), at the end of the clause, add:*\r\n>\r\n>> *and; (d) to ensure that the National Interest Framework and Future Made in Australia support are consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.*\r\n>\r\n> *(4) Clause 4, page 5 (lines 1 to 24), omit the clause, substitute:*\r\n>\r\n>> *4 Simplified outline of this Act*\r\n>>\r\n>> *This Act establishes the National Interest Framework, a framework to:*\r\n>>\r\n>>> *The National Interest Framework consists of the net zero transformation stream and the economic and climate change resilience and security stream.*\r\n>>>\r\n>>> *The Minister may, after consulting appropriate Ministers, direct the Secretary to conduct a sector assessment. A sector assessment is an assessment of a sector of the Australian economy conducted for the purpose of analysing the extent to which the sector aligns with the National Interest Framework in one of those streams, as well as opportunities to address barriers to private investment, in the national interest, in relation to the sector.*\r\n>>>\r\n>>> *A person or body deciding whether certain support (known as Future Made in Australia support) should be provided by the Commonwealth, a Commonwealth entity or a Commonwealth company must have regard to the community benefit principles.
