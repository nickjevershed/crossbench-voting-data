Daniel](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/goldstein/zoe_daniel) (Independent), which means it failed.\r\n\r\n### What did the amendment do?\r\n\r\nMs Daniel [explained that](https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debate/?id=2022-11-24.66.1):\r\n\r\n> *This amendment goes to the leaking of documents and the potential for journalists, particularly from the public broadcasters, to be penalised for receiving such documents, the fear of which, I believe, can thwart investigative journalism and, by extension, damage democracy.*\r\n\r\nRead more about the bill in
