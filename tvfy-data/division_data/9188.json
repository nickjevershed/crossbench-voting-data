I ask the minister to consider this in all certainty because this is a really problematic issue for many Australian students, as he knows.*\r\n>\r\n> *[...]*\r\n>\r\n> *Insult is again added to injury by the fact that the tax office collects HECS payments throughout the year but doesn't adjust the balance owing until a tax return is filed. That means it doesn't adjust the balance to reflect the payments made by graduates until after indexation is applied. Students end up paying more than they expect, and it's not fair. They have seen their debts increase, despite their best efforts to pay them off. My understanding is that, through this means, the government is accruing as much as $1 billion a year in additional income. This is at the expense of graduates. It's not fair or reasonable, and my amendments include the suggestion that the government change the timing of indexation, applying it after payments have been accrued to graduates' balances, to redress this inequity.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Clause 2, page 2 (after table item 6), insert:*\r\n>\r\n>> *6A.
