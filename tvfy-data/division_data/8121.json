Currently, the appointments are made at the minister's discretion. I am calling for an independent selection panel. This independent selection panel would shortlist the candidates with the right expertise, and the minister would be able to choose from that shortlist and would still have an element of discretion left to them in being able to choose the final appointment from that shortlist.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Schedule 1, item 22, page 12 (line 30) to page 13 (line 1), omit paragraph

person will have been appointed to act in the office for a total period of 6 consecutive months or more.*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(2) An appointment must not be made unless:*\r\n>>\r\n>>> *(a) the selection of the person for the appointment is the result of a process that includes:*\r\n>>>\r\n>>>> *(i) public advertising of selection criteria for the position; and*\r\n>>>>\r\n>>>> *(ii) assessment of applications against the selection criteria by an independent panel consisting of at least 3 members and chaired by a former judge; and*\r\n>>>>\r\n>>>> *(iii) shortlisting of at least 3 persons for
