Because this motion failed, the rules will continue.\r\n\r\n### Why was this motion introduced?\r\n\r\nClark MP [Andrew Wilkie](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/clark/andrew_wilkie) (Independent), who introduced the motion, [explained his reasoning](https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2022-10-27.156.2):\r\n\r\n> *in April 2022\u2014this year!\u2014the then coalition government made regulations which effectively reduced the live-export prohibition period during the Northern Hemisphere summer? I remind members that those regulations made by the previous government allowed Australian exporters to take sheep through the Red Sea to Israel for that two-week period from 1 to 14 June, which had been previously banned. Moreover, in terms of the ban on exporting to some Persian Gulf destinations, including Qatar\u2014although not the major live export ports of Oman and Kuwait\u2014live exporting was allowed to begin a week earlier, on 22 May, this year. Effectively, this means there was an 11-day reduction in the prohibition on exporting sheep to Qatar and a 14-day reduction in the prohibition on exporting sheep to Red Sea destinations.*", "votes":
