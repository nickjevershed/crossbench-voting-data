The amendment would have added the text below.\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *That all words after \"That\" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:*\r\n>\r\n> *\"whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House*\r\n>\r\n> *(1) notes that:*\r\n>\r\n>> *(a) Australia continues to be responsible for an animal welfare crisis;*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(b) while much of this crisis is historically and constitutionally the responsibility of the state and territory governments, it can be seen in many industries including but not limited to: cattle; sheep; aquaculture; poultry; pigs; the breeding of dogs and cats; and where the gambling industry intersects with thoroughbred horseracing, steeplechasing, harness racing and greyhound racing;*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(c) the systemic cruelty in the live animal export trade continues, with the export of sheep to the Middle East and beef cattle worldwide exemplifying the worst of animal abuse; and*\r\n>\r\n> *(2) calls on the Government to:*\r\n>\r\n>> *(a) establish a genuinely independent office of animal welfare which, by working with state and territory governments and their agencies, will take a policy development and leadership role to ensure that all animals are treated humanely and with dignity;*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(b) develop a much-improved legal framework to ensure that beef cattle and sheep are treated ethically during all stages of the live export process, so long as the live export industry exists; and*\r\n>>\r\n>> *(c) commit to legislating within six months a ban on all live sheep and beef cattle exports by sea with the ban fully implemented within three years.*", "votes": [{"vote": "aye", "member": {"id": 751, "person": {"id": 10929}, "first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Haines",
