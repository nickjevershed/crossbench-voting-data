I'm concerned that the absence of such a principle to drive the participation of women in our net zero economy will leave 50 per cent of our population uninvolved and unempowered and create yet another high-vis male workforce.*\r\n>\r\n> *My second amendment would empower the Department of the Treasury itself to initiate sector assessments. One need only look to the Productivity Commission\u2014indeed, in the Treasurer's own portfolio\u2014to a model which possesses an element of independence and protection against ministerial interference. The Productivity Commission, while taking direction for assessments by its minister, can determine areas of the economy to conduct research in, as it deems appropriate. I can't see anything in this bill to prevent a future minister from simply not directing the Department of the Treasury to conduct sector assessments at all should it not be in the political interests of the government of the day.*\r\n>\r\n> *My third amendment would add an additional eligibility criteria to the net zero transformation stream to ensure that FMIA supports are committed only to projects which would substantially contribute to climate change mitigation and net zero. Projects that receive Commonwealth support must be able to substantiate precisely how they would implement this funding towards what should be the primary goal of this legislation\u2014that is, net zero by 2050.*\r\n\r\n> *My fourth amendment addresses the vast gaps of accountability and financial reporting the Treasury and funding recipients would be expected to produce once the funding has been delivered. Treasury would be expected to detail the intended objectives that each of its recommendations in sector assessments would intend to achieve, including how success would be measured, review potential barriers to these objectives and, importantly, specify a duration for these supports. It is vital that the renewable industries which the legislation seeks to build are sustainable and able to be competitive in the market once their Future Made in Australia support has ceased. I commend these amendments to the House.*\r\n\r\n### Amendment text\r\n\r\n> *(1) Clause 3, page 4 (line 24), omit \"workforce participation\", substitute \"the participation of underrepresented
