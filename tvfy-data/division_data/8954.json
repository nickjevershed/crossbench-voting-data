This Prime Minister is so desperate to detract and distract from Labor's complicity and backing of the invasion that is taking place at the moment that they will come in here and make spurious allegations\u2014\n\nGovernment members interjecting\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nOrder! Members on my right!\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nagainst Greens members of parliament that need to be corrected.\n\nMilton Dick\n\nThe Leader of the Australian Greens will just pause.\n\nThe member for Fisher knows better than that. Members on my right, I can barely hear a word that is being said. If anyone interjects on my right during this period, they'll be ejected immediately. I want to hear from the Deputy Leader of the House.\n\nMark Butler\n\nThe standing orders in _P__ractice_ in relation to personal explanations are clear. The member needs to explain where he has been misrepresented. He immediately launched into an attack on the Prime Minister. I ask that he be brought back to pointing out where he has been misrepresented.\n\nMilton Dick\n\nI'll just allow the leader to continue so he can explain to the House where he was misrepresented and how he was misrepresented\u2014not whether he liked being misrepresented or not. I hope that's clear. The Leader of the Australian Greens has the call.\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nIn a desperate attempt to distract from Labor's backing of the invasion of Gaza, the Prime Minister made a number of representations\u2014\n\nGovernment members interjecting\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nOrder! Members on my right!\n\nOrder! The member for Canberra will leave the chamber under standing order 94(a). There are to be no more interjections.\n\n_The member for Canberra then left the chamber._\n\nThe member for Melbourne needs to explain exactly where\u2014\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nThere were misrepresentations about myself and Greens MPs in this parliament that need to be corrected. We have been crystal clear that the Greens, as a party of peace and nonviolence, support protest that is peaceful\u2014\n\nHonourable members interjecting\u2014\n\nAnd we have made it crystal clear, including on the record, that that should be the case. But instead\u2014\n\nMark Dreyfus\n\nYou've been doing this for months\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nThe Attorney-General will leave the chamber under 94(a)! No-one is to interject while I'm hearing this!\n\n_The member for Isaacs then left the chamber._\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nInstead, the Prime Minister, backed up by the Leader of the Opposition, came in here and made wide-ranging sprays attempting to connect the peaceful protests of people who are seeking to make their views about Labor's complicity with this genocide heard with the actions of other people, including here in this place.\n\nLet us be absolutely crystal clear\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nThe member for Griffith on a point of order and then the member for Wannon.\n\nMax Chandler-Mather\n\nThis is a matter in relation to the standing orders, Mr Speaker. A member of the Labor Party there, I'm not actually sure of his title, made a reflection on the Leader of the Australian Greens and I'd like him to come back in and withdraw.\n\nOpposition members interjecting\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nOrder! Members on my left! I didn't hear that\u2014\n\nMax Chandler-Mather\n\nIt was the member for Solomon.\n\nMilton Dick\n\nWell, I shall deal with the member of Solomon separately to this issue. I didn't hear what was said, so I can't take action on that matter. The member for Wannon on a point of order.\n\nDan Tehan\n\nMr Speaker, a point of order: the leader of the Greens has been asked to go to where he has been misrepresented, and he is not going there. He continues to defy your ruling that he should, and I think the House is not being advanced by the leader of the Greens' conduct.\n\nMilton Dick\n\nI'm going to give the leader of the Greens one more chance to explain exactly where he has been misrepresented.\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nMr Speaker, I've made it clear that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition made a number of severe and direct misrepresentations about actions that are taking place outside this place, when we have been crystal clear on the record about our approach to how people should exercise protests. Instead, a number of severe misrepresentations were made. Why? Because they're attempting to distract from their complicity. And that's why I seek leave to move that so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Melbourne from moving the following motion:\n\nThat this House:\n\n(1) notes:\n\n(a) The state of Israel has signed a $3 billion contract with the United States for a further 25 F-35 fighter aircraft;\n\n(b) Australia plays a significant role in the F-35 fighter aircraft global supply chain with a range of components manufactured here in Australia, including the sole manufacturing of F-35 fighter aircraft's uplock actuator system, which allows the F-35 to drop its payload; and\n\n(c) the F-35 fighter aircraft are being used to bomb the people of Gaza; and\n\n(2) calls on the Government to immediately end all direct and indirect trade of military equipment with the State of Israel, including the provision of critical components of the F-35 fighter jet supply chain.\n\nIt is critical that we debate this motion now, because Labor is attempting to do anything to distract from their complicity in the unfolding genocide. A\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nResume your seat\u2014\n\nAdam Bandt\n\nI'm happy to stand up\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nOrder! Resume your seat! The Deputy Leader of the House?\n\nMark Butler\n\nMr Speaker, the member had the right to issue a personal explanation, so I now move:\n\nThat the member no longer be heard.\n\n_A division having been called and the bells being/having been rung\u2014_\n\nGovernment members interjecting\u2014\n\nMilton Dick\n\nThe Leader of the Australian Greens will cease interjecting.\n\nGovernment members interjecting\u2014\n\nThe Leader of the Australian Greens is now warned, and members on my right will remain silent during the division.\n\nThe question is that the Leader of the Australian Greens no longer be heard.\n\n", "votes": [{"vote": "aye", "member": {"id": 752, "person": {"id": 10930}, "first_name": "Kate", "last_name": "Thwaites", "electorate": "Jagajaga", "party": "Australian Labor
